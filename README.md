* This repository has an **experiential learning** demo of an use-case on Insurance Cross Sell Prediction


## What is Cross-Sell?
* Cross-selling is a sales technique involving the selling of an additional product or service to an existing customer.

* It is done mainly in three forms.
  * Selling something that is completely unrelated but the customer has a need for it
  * Adding top-ups/ add-on on existing services or products such that it increases value to existing customers
  * Giving full range of solutions by offering package of services or products


* In this use case we will be working on one such cross selling use case of a fictitious company called Winsure

## Case Study

* Winsure is an insurance company that primarily deals with **health insurance**. 

* They are one of the leading insurance providers in the country. 

* Winsure is looking for **business expansion** and wants to start a division on **Auto Insurance**.

* Winsure is looking for jumpstart in sales of insurances of this new division.

* After discussing with business leaders, Winsure thought that leveraging **existing customer database** through **cross-selling strategies** will give them the jump start they are looking for.

*  Through a quick campaign they would like to **model** the **customers responses** and would like to build a **machine learning solution** that helps that improve and implemented a better **targeted campaigns** for better **sales groth rate**

* As a data scientist how would you approach this scenario.
